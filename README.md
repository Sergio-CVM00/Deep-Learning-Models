### Perceptron Logic Gates

In this project, we will use perceptrons to model the fundamental building blocks of computers — logic gates
- We’ll discuss how an AND gate can be thought of as linearly separable data and train a perceptron to perform AND.
- We’ll also investigate an XOR gate — a gate that outputs a 1 only if one of the inputs is a 1
