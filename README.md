### Perceptron Logic Gates

In this project, we will use perceptrons to model the fundamental building blocks of computers — logic gates
- We’ll discuss how an AND gate can be thought of as linearly separable data and train a perceptron to perform AND.
- We’ll also investigate an XOR gate — a gate that outputs a 1 only if one of the inputs is a 1

### Implementing Neural Networks
The World Health Organization (WHO)’s Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository tracks life expectancy for countries worldwide by following health status and many other related factors.

Although there have been a lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition, and mortality rates, it was found that the effects of immunization and human development index were not taken into account.

This dataset covers a variety of indicators for all countries from 2000 to 2015 including:
- immunization factors
- mortality factors
- economic factors
- social factors
- other health-related factors

Ideally, this data will eventually inform countries concerning which factors to change in order to improve the life expectancy of their populations. If we can predict life expectancy well given all the factors, this is a good sign that there are some important patterns in the data. Life expectancy is expressed in years, and hence it is a number. This means that in order to build a predictive model one needs to use regression.

### Regression with admissions data

# Classification
In this project, you will use a dataset from Kaggle to predict the survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction, and other factors such as age, anemia, diabetes, and so on.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs, and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity, and harmful alcohol use using population-wide strategies.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.
